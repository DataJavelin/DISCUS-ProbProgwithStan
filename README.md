# Requirements for Course
A laptop with working Python 3 installation with PyStan and Jupyter notebook installed would be useful. 

Alternatively, participants can use our docker image, which has fully working software stack (including Jupyter notebook). Can be found on our docker hub repository https://hub.docker.com/r/datajavelin/mindlab:0.3 and would suggest downloading before course.
